# 08_recommender-system
in this notebook `personal_rating.ipynb` I gave manually 50 ratings for movies and saved it as xlxs-file `pop_movies_rated.xlsx`. Then I transformed this xlxs-file back in in my notebook to a suitable shape and added them by the concat function to the original `ratings.csv`, which can be run through the notebook `movies-mvp_rias.ipynb`. Here I can use the user-based recommender chat-bot for the userId 611.
