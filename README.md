# 08_recommender-system
in this notebook `personal_rating.ipynb` I prepared a table to rate popular movies and exported them as `pop_movies.xlsx`. Afterwards, I gave manually 50 ratings and saved it as xlxs-file `pop_movies_rated.xlsx`. Then I imported the rated xlxs-file back in in my notebook, transformed it to a suitable shape and added them by the concat function to the original `ratings.csv`, which can be run through the notebook `movies-mvp_rias.ipynb`. Here I can use the user-based recommender chat-bot for the userId 611.
